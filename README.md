# My Lightning Fast React.js Template

This is my opinionated React.js template. I usually use it as a lab for trying js code, React.js code, libs, etc. But this is also a template to help me (and probably you!) bootstrap new projects.
To have the best dev experience possible, I picked these technologies (they may change overtime, you know how fast the js ecosystem evolves LOL.):

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org) & [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/)
- [UnoCSS + TailwindCSS preset](https://github.com/unocss/unocss), [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/), [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) & [msw](https://mswjs.io/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (lightning fast frontend build tool)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) + [@testing-library/jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#table-of-contents) + [@testing-library/react-hooks](https://react-hooks-testing-library.com/usage/basic-hooks) (unit & integration testing)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (my linting and styling rules)
- [Cypress](https://cypress.io/) (E2E testing)
- Commits: [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
- Storybook (UI component explorer)

# TODO:

- Add husky + git-cz + commitizen + lint-staged
- Add vite-plugin-ssr
- Setup CI with github actions

WIP:

- add absolute path
- running storybook server works but loading stories does not work..
